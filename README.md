# Welcome

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/wikibanner.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## G'day Champions üèÜ - Welcome to my Info-Tech Wiki <a href="#gday-champions-welcome-to-the-cyb3rn8te-wiki" id="gday-champions-welcome-to-the-cyb3rn8te-wiki"></a>

This wiki serves as a repository of knowledge acquired through four years of hands-on experience in the information technology and cybersecurity field.

Having worked as a systems administrator, junior security analyst, and malware analyst, I have gained extensive exposure to various software tools, hardware, attack/defence procedures, and security best practices.

IT alone involves a vast amount of continuous learning, and adding cybersecurity on top of that makes it feel almost impossible to keep up. I wanted to create a centralised system where I can safely and effectively document everything I've learned in a structured way. The goal is to have an easily accessible resource to recall important information, like scripts, software usage, attack methods, and defence strategies, whenever needed.

Although this wiki is primarily intended to support my own learning and reference, I have made it publicly accessible in the hope that others may also find its content informative or valuable.

Cheers,

Nathan
