# Hard disk drive

When selecting a hard disk drive (HDD), the choice largely depends on whether you're deploying the drives in a server or NAS environment versus using them for file storage on a desktop computer. In a server or NAS environment, you'll want a drive that is optimised for 24/7 operation, reliability, and high capacity, as these systems typically handle more intensive workloads and need to ensure continuous uptime. For a typical home desktop environment, where the drive is used primarily for storing files, games, or media, performance requirements may not be as demanding, and a standard consumer-grade HDD will usually suffice.&#x20;
