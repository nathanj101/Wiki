# System Dataset

The TrueNAS system dataset contains important configuration and logging data that is critical to the operation of the system. Some of the key components stored in the system dataset include:

1. **System Logs**: Logs generated by various system services such as SMB, SSH, FTP, and other services running on TrueNAS. These logs are crucial for diagnosing issues and tracking the operation of the system.
2. **Reporting Database**: This includes the performance data and statistics that are used for reporting and monitoring the system's health. It covers metrics like CPU usage, disk I/O, network traffic, and other system performance indicators.
3. **SMB (Samba) Configuration**: TrueNAS uses SMB to share files with Windows clients, and part of the system dataset contains metadata related to SMB, like share settings and user connections.
4. **Alert Settings**: Information regarding alert thresholds and event triggers that notify administrators of potential issues within the system.
5. **Replication Logs**: If replication tasks are set up, the logs and progress data are stored in the system dataset.
6. **Core Dumps**: If the system crashes, a core dump can be generated and saved in the system dataset. These files help in debugging the cause of a crash.
7. **System Dataset on Pools**: In TrueNAS, the system dataset can be stored on the boot pool or another data pool, which helps to prevent filling up the boot pool with logs and statistics.

## Recommended Configuration

I recommend setting the system dataset to the boot pool for the following reasons:

1. The boot pool, when configured as a mirror (which is highly recommended in any production environment), provides redundancy and fault tolerance. Since the boot pool is already designed to protect critical system data through mirroring, placing the system dataset on this pool ensures that the logs, configuration files, and reporting databases are also protected with the same level of redundancy.
2. We avoid consuming valuable space on the data pool.
3. We avoid unnecessary I/O overhead on the primary storage.
4. Should the system need to be recovered or restored, having the boot pool hold both the system dataset and the TrueNAS OS simplifies the recovery process.
