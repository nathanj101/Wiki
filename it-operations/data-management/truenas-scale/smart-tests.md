# SMART Tests

Short and long SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) tests are diagnostic tools used to assess the health of a disk. A **short SMART test** is a quick check, typically lasting a few minutes, that reviews a drive's major components, such as the read/write heads, motor, and electronics, but doesn't perform a thorough scan of the disk surface. In contrast, a **long SMART test** is more comprehensive, taking several hours to complete, as it performs a detailed surface scan of the entire disk to check for bad sectors and other deeper issues. Both tests help in predicting potential drive failures, but the long test provides more thorough coverage, while the short test is useful for frequent, quick health checks.
